# CMSC 477 Project 3
We focused on implementing obstacle avoidance (static and dynamic)
and having our receiver and giver robots navigate to the blue
line of the workspace to block our opponents from passing legos
during the competition. This script that achieves this
is `obstacle_avoid.py`. `giver_lego.py` and `receiver_lego.py`
scripts are work in progress which attempts to retrieve and pass
the legos. However, these scripts are not functional.
